	<h4 align="center"> Patrolling is one important aspect of civil police activities. Supervisory officers identify the location of deployment, teams and personnel to be deployed at the location and regularly supervise the patrol teams. Through the intermediary officers, the activities are supervised in the legacy method of physical inspection. Of the many shortcomings comprised in the physical inspection, the most important one is the lack of real-time location data <h4>

Bishnupur District police has developed this app in collaboration with student members of Google Developers Student Club, VIT University, Vellore, Tamil Nadu. This app focusses on effective management of manpower deployed in patrol, ROP and other pertinent security duties. We have identified 29 locations in the district, which will be manned by the personnel of VDF posts and Police Stations. The patrol parties will be in field 24/7 taking turns in 3 shifts. Each patrol team has a commander. The app will be installed in the mobile phones of the team commanders and they shall log-in when their turn starts. The identified patrol locations are geo-marked using GPS  coordinates. When the user with supervisory privileges Viz. SP and other GO's log in the app, the real time location of the patrolling team relative to the marked  patrolling point will be visible in the screen.
